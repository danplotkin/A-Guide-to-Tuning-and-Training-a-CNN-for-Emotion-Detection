# A-Guide-to-Tuning-and-Training-a-CNN-for-Emotion-Detection

In this project, I will be using Python to demonstrate how to build, tune, and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras and Keras Tuner to predict emotion based on image data.

***Note**: This project is not meant to be presented as the final optimized model for deployment, but rather a demonstration in building and tuning a CNN.*
